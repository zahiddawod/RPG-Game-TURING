# RPG-Game-TURING

This is my RPG Game Project coded in my first programming language.

Please run the main.t file using Turing 4.1.1 if you would like to play this game. Once opened, click the 'Run' button at the top of the window.
The game will then begin. Once it has started you will be shown a loading screen (Don't worry) It's doing its thing.
Now once the loading bar has completed you will be located at the Main Menu.
From here on you're on your own!

Enjoy the Game!
